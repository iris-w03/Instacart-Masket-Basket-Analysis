**Data Set:**

In this project, there are six datasets describing customer’s orders over time, which contain a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. These datasets were sourced from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)

**Project Description:**

Instacart is a hot American tech company that operates same-day delivery and pick-up services by sending a “personal shopper” to fulfill customer’s orders.
For this project, we:

* Predict which products a customer will buy again using transactional data using multiple machine learning models
* Recommend the bundles of products to customers through Apriori Algorithm
* Segment out customers based on purchase activity through KMeans
